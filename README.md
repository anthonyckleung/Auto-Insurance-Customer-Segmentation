# Customer Segmentation on Auto Insurance Clients

Not often do insurance companies get many new client very frequently and so the way these companies earn revenue is through monthly premiums for the protection policies that they provide. Having said this, insurance companies can expect to lose out some earnings through claims. So the challenge here for insurance companies is to keep Claims-to-Premium ratio low. One way to do this is by making recommendations to clients that is appropriate for their needs. The focus for this analysis is auto insurance.

**Goal**: Perform a segmentation analysis on current clients based on their car properties and insurance plan(s).
